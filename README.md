# Loan Approval Prediction - Exploratory Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand the factors influencing loan approval predictions. The dataset contains various details about loan applicants, such as marital status, applicant income, credit history, and requested loan amount.

## Project Contents
- **project_LoanApproval_train_EDA.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the code used for exploratory data analysis, including key statistics and visualizations.
- **README.md**: Documentation file providing an overview of the project.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following libraries:
- Python >= 3.7
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Install the requirements by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data
The dataset includes information about loan applications and approval status, with key columns such as:
- **ApplicantIncome**: Applicant's income
- **LoanAmount**: Requested loan amount
- **Credit_History**: Applicant's credit history
- **Loan_Status**: Loan approval status (target variable)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/loan-approval-prediction.git
   ```
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook project_LoanApproval_train_EDA.ipynb
   ```

3. Run each cell in the notebook to explore and visualize insights in the data.

## Results
Key insights from the EDA include:
- Correlations between applicant characteristics (e.g., credit history, income) and loan approval likelihood.
- Visualizations of income and loan distributions among different demographics.

## Future Improvements
- Perform feature engineering to improve model accuracy.
- Develop a full machine learning pipeline for real-time loan approval predictions.
